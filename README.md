# Blueberry Colorful Dark Theme

I customized the Blueberry theme for myself. There are less and more colorful options.

Based on [DuoTone Syntax](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax) with a little change.

### Installation
Just copy the files from this repo to '~/.vscode/extensions' folder


### Bracket color
If you want your editor bracket to match with your theme colors and you don't like vscode bracket colorization, add this to your settings:
```json
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false
```
